# Quick start without Azure DPS

In this tutorial, we will walk the reader through the minimal steps to get a debug version of the Device Agent running on a Windows IoT device.

For a quick start on Windows IoT Core with Azure DPS, see this [page](quick-start-with-dps.md).

- Download a pre-built version of the client: [x86](../../downloads/device.agent.2.0.0.5.x86.zip), [x64](../../downloads/device.agent.2.0.0.5.x64.zip), or [arm](../../downloads/device.agent.2.0.0.5.arm.zip).
- Extract to a folder (i.e c:\deploy.arm)
- Update the c:\deploy.arm\bin\AzureDeviceManagementClient.json with the connection string.
- From an admin window, run the client:
    <pre>
    cd c:\deploy.arm\bin
    AzureDeviceManagementClient.exe -install
    net start AzureDeviceManagementClient
    </pre>

**Note**: If you are running on Windows Enterprise, you will need to [enable embedded mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/embeddedmode).
